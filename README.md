## Project_Image_Captioning
With the help of this project, machine can generate its own captions related to the image. The model uses Flickr dataset for training data and uses LSTM for training.

# The Model made contains:

1) Image model: for reducing image of high dimensions into selected features.
2) Language model: for creating output as embeddings to reduce complexity of model.
3) Final model: which will concatenate results of both this model and will use LSTM layer and Time Distributed layer for doing final_predicttions.
  
  
# One of example of final prediction:
